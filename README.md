## Information

When adding a radiostation be sure to use directlinks.
	For example, a link like this won't work:
	https://www.radio.de/s/hr3
	
	Please try to find directlinks like this:
	http://metafiles.gl-systemhaus.de/hr/hr3_2.m3u
Because it is smoetimes hard to find correct link, there is a "Prelisten" function implemented.
Also SSL URLs won´t work properly, mostly you can reach radiostation per URL when trim to <i>http://</i> instead of <i>https://</i>

Added wrong Radiostaion or you have a typo? You can uncheck <b>"Save Webstation-list at exit"</b> before closing
the player, your new list won´t be saved!
You can also editing the list by jump into folder "RadioStations" where application is installed and open
"RadioStation-List.csv" file.

<b>Be sure to never delete headerrow and have no empty rows before last row.</b>
